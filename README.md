## Summary

Senior Front-End Engineer with 10+ years of experience building scalable, high-quality web applications, UI systems, and client-side architectures.  
My primary specialization is **front-end development with React and JavaScript**, including state management, real-time features, performance optimization, complex UI/UX, and product-focused development.

I also have strong backend experience with **Node.js** and **Go**, building APIs, microservices, WebSocket services, and working with PostgreSQL.  
Additionally, I’ve built and published mobile apps using **React Native**, and I’m comfortable setting up CI/CD for web, backend, and mobile.

Throughout my career, I often acted as a **Product Engineer / Product Manager hybrid**, taking responsibility for feature discovery, requirement clarification, UX logic, prioritization, and cross-team communication. I can independently define product flows, user scenarios, and interface logic when design or specifications are incomplete.

Long-term remote experience working with teams in the USA, Japan, and Europe.
